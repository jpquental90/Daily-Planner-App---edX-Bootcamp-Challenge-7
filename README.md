# Daily Planner App

This repository contains my answer to the Module 7 Challenge of the Web Development edX bootcamp: https://jpquental90.github.io/Daily-Planner-App---edX-Bootcamp-Challenge-7/

## Description

My task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. Some starter code was provided by edX in HTML and CSS files. A gif demonstrating the desired look of the final product was provided as a guide.

## Usage

#### Overall look of the app

The hours of the day are colour-blocked in grey, red or green depending on whether they are past, present or future.

#### Storage function

The user can click on the padlock button to save their work day entry. An alert message is displayed to confirm the successful save. Upon refresh of the page, the information remains available to the user.

## Code

In order to apply the knowledge developed in recent classes, I avoid directly changing the HTML and CSS files (only a couple of minor adjustments were made) and, as an exercise, added relevant HTML and CSS properties on Javascript where required. I also used jQuery as much as possible, as that was at the core of this weekly challenge.

## Credits

I have used Google to research the tools I needed for this challenge. I consulted 'getbootstrap.com', day.js and jQuery documentation, W3schools and Stack Overflow. I had a tutoring session on the 19th January 2024. I have used the edX bootcamp Xpert Learning Assistant to help troubleshoot some of the problems with the code. I also consulted some of the material from the edX bootcamp classes.
